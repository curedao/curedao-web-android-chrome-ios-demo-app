# Automating Task Creation

To automate the creation of GitHub issues for tasks listed in the `docs/treaty/strategy.md` document, you can use the `create_issues_from_strategy_doc.py` script. This script allows for bulk creation of issues, which can save time when dealing with multiple tasks. However, it should be used with caution to avoid creating duplicate issues.

## Prerequisites

- **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Necessary Python Packages**: The script requires the `requests` package. Install it using pip:
  ```
  pip install requests
  ```
- **GitHub API Token**: You need a GitHub API token with the necessary permissions to create issues in the repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub to create your token.

## Running the Script

1. Ensure all prerequisites are met.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `create_issues_from_strategy_doc.py` script.
3. Run the script with the following command:
  ```
  python create_issues_from_strategy_doc.py
  ```

Remember to use this script responsibly to avoid creating duplicate issues.
